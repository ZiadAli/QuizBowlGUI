# QuizBowlGUI

This program is meant to serve as both a scorekeeper and a statistics tracker for Quiz Bowl. The program allows users to keep score for practice games and whole tournaments, enables them to track how well players are performing in certain categories, and can produce a full HTML report to publish on HSQuizbowl. The program will write all stats to an Excel sheet in addition to displaying those stats in the user interface.
